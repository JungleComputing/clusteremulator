============================
ClusterEmulator installation
============================

-----
Build
-----

Build by typing 'ant'.

A 'lib/' directory will be created containing a JAR file with all the cluster 
emulator code.


---------------------
Linux Traffic Control
---------------------

You must be able to execute the following command on the cluster nodes: 

   sudo /sbin/tc
   
If you do not have sufficient right to this, then contact your local system 
administrator. 


----------------------
Ibis Portability Layer
----------------------

The application 'clusteremulator.test.PingPongTest' uses the Ibis Portability 
Layer (IPL) to communicate. The cluster emulator source tree only includes the 
IPL API to allow compilation. To actually run the application you also need 
an IPL implementation, which can be downloaded from http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis.

The environment variable IPL_HOME should point to the installation directory
of the Ibis Portability Layer.
